            <h3> This scene is very important to the travelers all the time, but especially during the global pandemic. Users can check what percentage of the hospitalized patients passes away. This could be the indicator of how well the medical service in certain countries are managed during the global pandemic. This is highly important due to the increase number of hospitalized patients and decreasing of the available medical staff to take care fo the patients. PanExpedia team members do not want our users to get sick at the first point, but we also do not want users to get get enough medical care when they are in the sever condition. </h3>
            <h3> The y-axis value of this chart is the (average of daily COVID-19 related hospitalization number) / (average of daily COVID-19 related death number). This would let users to conclude which country has more higher rate to die when hospitalized due to the shortage of medical support. Therefore, the higher in the hospitalization number and the lower in the death number, patients are likely to get sufficient medical support to prevent from the death. </h3>
            <h3> The size of the bubble indicates the population, the bigger size of the bubble, the larger population number.</h3>
